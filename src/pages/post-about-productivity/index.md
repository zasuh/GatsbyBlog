If you have a programming blog you have to write a post about programmer productivity. It's kind of like a ritual to be accepted into the pantheon of programming bloggers (next to writing your opinion on the industry and how it has changed as a whole).

Productivity in programming is weird when you are starting out. You think that you aren't making any progress when you just play around with HTML and CSS, because those aren't ReAlll programming languages, when in reality you are learning the basics for whats to come. You can't properly learn how to make web apps with just JS because eventually you are gonna run into some problem that requires HTML or CSS knowledge at a much deeper level. So you are making progress I assure you.

The type of productivity I'm referring to is how to properly get something done that you have set out to do and not spend hours just watching tutorials. What I'm saying is that to me **productivity is when you are actively moving towards a goal**. You don't have to consistently move towards the goal, yes it is prefered, but not necessary as long as you are moving. There is this great quote that I don't know the source of anymore, but it says **It's much easier to steer a moving train than a not moving train**. Once you have some momentum towards the goal all you have to keep doing is correcting your path to the finish line.

Taking development as an example. It takes ages for someone that hasn't programmed before to actually become really productive, but they are still productive in some sense. They are learning and learning takes a very long time to make into production of value. And that sucks, but it sucks all the time because we as developers are always learning and consiquently always feeling like shit because we don't 'know' enough. It's something that comes with the job.

Thank you for reading!
