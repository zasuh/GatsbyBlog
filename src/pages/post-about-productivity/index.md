If you have a programming blog you have to write a post about programmer productivity. It's kind of like a ritual to be accepted into the pantheon of programming bloggers (next to writing your opinion on the industry and how it has changed as a whole).

Productivity in programming is weird when you are starting out. You think that you aren't making any progress when you just play around with HTML and CSS, because those aren't ReAlll programming languages, when in reality you are learning the basics for whats to come. You can't properly learn how to make web apps with just JS because eventually you are gonna run into some problem that requires HTML or CSS knowledge at a much deeper level. So you are making progress I assure you.

The type of productivity I'm referring to is how to properly get something done that you have set out to do and not spend hours just watching tutorials. What I'm saying is that to me **productivity is when you are actively moving towards a goal**.

Thank you for reading!
