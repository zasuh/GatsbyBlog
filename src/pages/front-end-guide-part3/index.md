## ROAD TO GETTING A JOB ##

Welcome! By now you should have learned a lot of stuff regarding actual programming and have made some personal projects.
Now comes the other side of working as a developer. Most of the time when people think "Programmer" they think we sit
behind computers all day. That's about 90% true, but so do lawyers, doctors, accountants and most people working today.
What we all have in common in the working world is **communication**.

You can have all the knowledge in the world about computers, but if you can't communicate that knowledge to people who
don't have your level of understanding then you aren't as effective as you might think. In this part we are covering topics
such as soft skills, making yourself known in the employment world, resumes and that dreaded word... interview.

**Disclamer**: I live in the EU. More specifically Slovenia. We have tech companies large and small here. The market is pretty good
for programmers here. That said I can't speak for people outside of this country, but I will give you some advice where to find
people who know about your market and economy. What I'm trying to say is take the advice in this part and adapt it to your situation.

### SOFT SKILLS ###
What are [soft skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_skills)?.
Get some soft skills. Seriously. Talking to people as a new developer can be very difficult. You don't really know the terminology
just yet + just the general anxiety of talking to people is crippling a lot of the times. In part 1 I linked an article that
talks about how to properly ask programming questions. Same applies for real life. You are going to be talking to other developers,
business managers and people who aren't neither. Learn how to talk to all. Context switch in your head and communicate clearly.
If you want a fun podcast that is all about soft skills in the software engineering world listen to [Soft Skill Engineering](https://softskills.audio/).

At the end of the day, soft skills can only be learned if you constantly talk to people. Go to meetups, events and ask developers out for coffee.
The biggest thing you can do is be humble when talking to more senior people. You don't know everything, they don't either, but they have
way more experience than you. Talk, talk, talk. Maybe take a drama class? Improv? Standup? Oh and one more thing about communication: don't be a dick.
